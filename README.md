# Simple Text-to-Speach program
## How it works?
This program makes use of a library called pyttsx3. The library allows for programs to have a voice which is helpful in meeting the needs for the visually impared. The library can be used in Python 2 and 3 and is very simple to use. Link to its documentation [here](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/)

## How to use?
The program will as you a simple question, such as "what is your name?" and you as a user will type the responce. In the future I may remake this to use a voice as a response.

## Usage:
Completely no limits to use. Free to do as you wish.
